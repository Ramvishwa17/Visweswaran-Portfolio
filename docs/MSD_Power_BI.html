                </ul>
                <h3>Data Preparation and Transformation</h3>
                <h3 style="margin-left: 50px;">1. Cleaning and Importing Data</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">The raw CSV file was imported into Power BI, where data cleaning steps were applied. Key tasks included:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 150px;">
            <li>Addressing missing values.</li>
            <li>Formatting certain columns for analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 50px;">2. Calculated Columns and Measures</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Calculations were created to derive key metrics, including:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 150px;">
            <li><strong>Total Runs Scored</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Batting Average</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Hundreds and Fifties Count</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Total Sixes</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Strike Rate</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-left: 50px;">3. Aggregations and Grouping</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 100px;">Data was aggregated to provide insights at various levels, including:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 150px;">
            <li>Year-by-year performance.</li>
            <li>Performance against each opponent.</li>
            <li>Performance at different grounds.</li>
        </ul>
                <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web scraping, Data Cleaning and form a structured data.</li>
                    <li>Visualize match statistics over time.</li>
                    <li>Provide actionable insights for team on at which stage our teams is by comparing with the opponents.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
                <p>The project utilized the following technologies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python for data analysis and manipulation.</li>
                    <li>Pandas and NumPy for data processing.</li>
                    <li>Matplotlib for data visualization.</li>
                </ul>
                <section id="databricks-notebook">
                    <h2>Databricks Notebook</h2>

                <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <p>During the project, faced challenges in handling missing data and some data transformations which were finally giving almost perfect output after lot of tried and tested method.</p>
                <h3>To Be Improved</h3>
                <p>This output can be improved by the implementing below two ideas.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Need to start the graph on (0,0).</li>
                    <li>On the wickets only one circle is highlighting in one over. Need to show how many wickets fell on that over.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The project successfully provided insights that can help teams make informed decisions on how to keep up the rate with the opponents.</p>
